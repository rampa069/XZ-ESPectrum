# ZX-ESPectrum-Wiimote

An emulation of the ZX-Spectrum computer on an ESP32 chip with VGA output based on bitluni's driver, using a Wiimote as input device, based on bigw00d's driver.

There are per-game customizable (through simple text files) correspondences from Wiimote keys to Spectrum keys.

## Features

- VGA output, 8 or 16 bits.
- Beeper digital output.
- Accurate Z80 emulation.
- Spectrum 16/48 achitecture emulation without PSRAM.
- Spectrum 128/+2/+3 architecture emulation with PSRAM.
- Input using Bluetooth-connected Wiimote as gamepad.
- VGA OSD menu: Configuration, and architecture selection, ROM and SNA.
- Tape save and loading.
- SNA snapshot loading.
- Internal SPIFFS support.

## Compiling and installing

Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS/X. This version has been developed using 

#### Install platformIO:

- They have an extension for Atom and VSCode, and this is [the webpage](https://platformio.org/).
- Select your board, I have used a Espressif ESP32-WROVER
- Install Bitluni's ESP32Lib (use version 0.2.1, newer versions such as 0.3.3 will lead to compile errors)

#### Customize platformio.ini

Change upload_port to whatever you're using
```
upload_port = COM6
```

#### Upload the data filesystem

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > Upload File System Image`

All files under the `/data` subdirectory will be copied to the SPIFFS filesystem partition. Run this task whenever you add any file to the data subdirectory (e.g, adding games in SNA format).

#### Compile and flash it

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > Build `, then

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > Upload`.

Run these tasks (`Upload` also does a `Build`) whenever you make any change in the code.

## Hardware configuration and pinout

See ESP32 pin assignment in include/def/hardware.h or change it to your own preference.

I have used VGA 3 bit driver (so BRIGHT attribute is lost), but it's simpler to connect and no R-2R DAC is needed. Also, I have assigned pins to bottom side of the ESP32, as it is too wide for usual breadboards.

## Connecting a Wiimote

To connect, press 1 and 2 buttons in the Wiimote.

All 4 leds will flash during connection phase, and only LED 1 will be ON when connected.

## OSD Menu

OSD menu can be opened using the Wiimote's Home key. Navigation is done using the D-Pad, and selection using buttons A, 1 or 2.

From OSD you can load snapshots (from `/data/sna`) or change ROMs.

## Assigning Wiimote keys to emulated Spectrum keys
For every `.sna` game in `/data/sna`, there should be a corresponding `.txt` file in the same dir, with a very simple format. Examples are provided.

The `ESPWiimote` library generates the following codes for Wiimote keys:

![wiimote-key-codes](./doc/wiimote-key-codes.jpg)

The `.txt` file must have at least 16 characters (only first 16 characters are considered). For example for Manic Miner, `ManicMiner.txt` would contain

`sZ-h------WQe---`

There is a character for each possible 16 bit code of wiimote keys, in order: `0001`, `0002`, `0004`, `0008`, `0010`, `0020`, `0040`, `0080`, `0100`, `0200`, `0400`, `0800`, `1000`, `2000`, `4000`, `8000`; and legal characters are:

```
1234567890
QWERTYUIOP
ASDFGHJKLe
hZXCVBNMys
````
With `e` for ENTER, `h` for CAPS SHIFT, `y` for SYMBOL SHIFT and `s` for SPACE. Any other character (ex: '``') means not used.

For the Manic Miner example, the correspondences would be:

```
(2)    (0001) -> SPACE (jump)
(1)    (0002) -> Z     (jump)
(A)    (0008) -> SHIFT (jump)
(down) (0400) -> W     (right)
(up)   (0800) -> Q     (left)
(+)    (1000) -> ENTER (start)

```

I have NOT included Manic Miner `.sna` snapshot, but you can download it from [worldofspectrum.org](https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/software/games/manic-miner-bug-byte-software-ltd) and convert it to `.sna` using [FUSE](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/), for example.

## Notes

PS/2 keyboard support (present in [original project](https://github.com/rampa069/ZX-ESPectrum) from which this is a fork) has been removed in favor of Wiimote input. However, with a little of work it may be possible to make both coexist, as I have not removed the PS/2 code, but just commented out the `do_keyboard()` call in `ZX-ESPectrum.ino`.
